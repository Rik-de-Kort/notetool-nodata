# Notetool
This started as a shameless reimplementation of some features from [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) with

* No support whatsoever
* Written in Python/Flask and using only vanilla JavaScript
* A lot of bugs
* At least it doesn't cost 12 euros per month

If you want to use it, feel free to copy and do your own thing, but I won't accept pull requests or fix issues. If you want something fixed, do it better and allow me to steal the code.
